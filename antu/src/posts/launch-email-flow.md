Done-for-you email swipes rarely fit the story you built during your affiliate review. I architect a custom seven-email flow that runs for ten days and mirrors the testing narrative from my content. Here’s the structure, timing, and metrics I obsess over.

## Before the launch

I segment the list by persona and engagement level, create a preference center for unsubscribes, and warm up sending domains two weeks ahead with value-packed newsletters. I also build the automation map in ConvertKit, tagging subscribers when they click key CTAs so I can trigger personalized follow-ups.

## Email 1: Primer (Day 0)

Sent immediately after signup or announcement. Subject line promises transformation (“Stop losing hours to manual payouts”). Body restates the problem in a story format, introduces my credibility, and previews the bonus stack. CTA drives to the flagship review or comparison hub. I include a quick poll (“Which challenge hits hardest?”) to gather segmentation data.

## Email 2: Proof (Day 1)

Features one mini case study with quantifiable results. I embed a short Loom clip from my testing environment to show I touched the product. CTA invites readers to reply with their use case; responses fuel future copy and boost deliverability.

## Email 3: Behind the scenes (Day 3)

Peels back the curtain: test bench photos, analytics dashboards, workflow diagrams. Transparency helps skeptical readers trust the upcoming offer. CTA links to a Notion doc or Google Sheet showing raw data.

## Email 4: Offer breakdown (Day 5)

Walks through each plan tier, who it suits, and how my bonuses amplify the value. I stack offers visually with a table summarizing features, onboarding time, and exclusive perks only available via my link. CTA uses urgency but stays honest (“Only 40 onboarding slots remain”).

## Email 5: Objection crusher (Day 6)

Addresses the top three anxieties uncovered during JTBD interviews. Each section includes a testimonial, a data point, and a CTA to jump on a quick call or reply for help. I also link to a FAQ doc that updates in real time.

## Email 6: Deadline (Day 9 morning)

Reminds readers what expires—bonuses, concierge setup, or partner incentives. I include a countdown timer (text-based for deliverability) and highlight success metrics from early adopters. CTA goes straight to the purchase page with UTM tracking.

## Email 7: Last chance + value recap (Day 10 evening)

Summaries everything: pains solved, features covered, bonuses delivered, and what happens after purchase. I add alternative next steps (free community, waitlist) so unsubscribes stay low. CTA repeats once with a P.S. linking to the full review.

## Measurement + optimization

Every email uses consistent UTMs to track conversions in Looker Studio. I monitor open rate, click rate, reply volume, and revenue per send. A 20% test segment receives variant subject lines or CTAs before the full list. After the campaign, I note which emails drove the most revenue and adapt them for evergreen sequences.

### Copywriting tips

- Write like you speak on discovery calls—straight, earnest, jargon-free.\n- Use screenshots or GIFs sparingly; text-only emails often land better.\n- Add nested PS sections for readers who skim.\n- Include unsubscribes and preference links up top for compliance and trust.

## Bonus automations

- **Fast action replay:** If someone clicks in Email 1 but doesn’t buy, they receive a short reminder 24 hours later featuring just the bonuses.
- **Call scheduler:** Subscribers who click “book a call” get a Calendly follow-up with prep questions.
- **Onboarding nurture:** Buyers exit the promo flow and enter a success sequence with setup videos and shareable assets.

## Tech stack

ConvertKit or Klaviyo for automations, Deadline Funnel for timers, Fathom for analytics, and Notion for script storage. Everything ties back to the review so messaging stays coherent across channels.

## Case study: AI writing tool launch

I recently ran this sequence for an AI writing platform. The list had 12k subscribers segmented into three personas. By weaving in Loom proof and Notion templates across the sequence, we hit a 46% average open rate and 11% click rate. Revenue peaked on Email 4 (Offer breakdown) but Email 5 (Objection crusher) saved 22 deals from prospects worried about compliance. The automation also triggered 37 strategy calls, half of which converted into annual plans.

## Design + accessibility checklist

- Minimum 16px font, single-column layout.\n- Alt text for images, though I often omit images entirely.\n- High-contrast buttons for mobile readers.\n- Plain-text version synced with HTML.\n- Test across Gmail, Outlook, and iOS clients.\n- Preview on dark mode to ensure logos or timers remain legible.

## Post-launch retrospective

After the campaign I host a short retro with the partner. We review KPI dashboards, share subscriber feedback, and document ideas for the evergreen sequence. I also rewrite high-performing sections into landing page copy or social threads to wring out more value.

## Calendar view

I lay the entire flow out in Notion or FigJam so stakeholders see which day each persona receives what message. This avoids clashes with other promos and helps customer support prepare for influxes of replies. The visual timeline also highlights gaps—if two heavy emails land back to back, we adjust send times.

## Team workflow

Writer drafts the emails, strategist reviews for alignment, compliance checks disclosures, and operations loads the sequence. QA includes test sends to multiple inboxes plus link tracking verification. We store final copy and performance metrics in Notion for easy reuse.

## Quick checklist

- Segmented list with warmed-up domains\n- Automation map + tagging logic\n- Seven core emails with CTAs\n- Bonus automations + reminders\n- UTM tracking + dashboards\n- Testing plan for subject lines + CTAs\n- Retro + documentation after launch

## Final note

Launch emails shouldn’t feel like pressure cookers. When they retell the story you’ve already proven in your content, readers feel guided—not sold. Use this framework, measure relentlessly, and tweak per audience. The results compound every launch.
