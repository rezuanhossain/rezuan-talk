Demographic personas (“Sarah, 32, marketer”) don’t help affiliates. I need to know the job a reader is trying to get done and what worries keep them from taking action. Jobs-to-be-Done interviews give me those answers. Here’s how I run them and translate the insights into high-converting content.

## Step 1: Recruit the right mix

I schedule 20-minute interviews with three groups: recent buyers through my affiliate link, people who almost bought but chose differently, and customers who churned. Variety prevents echo chambers. I recruit via email, LinkedIn, or in-product notifications and offer a small gift card plus a summary of findings as thanks.

## Step 2: Timeline-style interviews

Instead of asking “Which features do you like?” I map the story chronologically:

1. “What triggered your search?”
2. “What solutions did you try before finding this product?”
3. “What almost prevented you from moving forward?”
4. “What outcome convinced you to buy or switch?”

Follow-up questions go deep on anxieties, desired progress, and the people influencing the decision. I record calls in Riverside and auto-transcribe them to Notion.

## Step 3: Force mapping

JTBD describes push, pull, inertia, and anxiety forces. I drop quotes into a Miro board with four quadrants. Example: “I worried the automation would break our SOPs” goes under anxiety. “We needed to cut manual reporting” goes under push. This visual map shows which themes repeat and which deserve entire sections in the review.

## Step 4: Persona briefs

Each persona gets a one-page brief including:

- Job statement (“Operations managers need to reconcile payouts without spreadsheets.”)
- Trigger events and desired outcomes.
- Top anxieties and the proof needed to overcome them.
- Preferred content format (tables, screenshots, video walkthroughs).
- Channel notes (hangs out in Slack communities, reads Reddit, etc.).

Writers and designers reference the brief when building reviews, comparison hubs, and email sequences so messaging stays aligned.

## Step 5: Feed insights into offers

If a persona fears onboarding chaos, I negotiate with partners for migration help or record my own setup checklist. If they crave ROI proof, I build calculators and share anonymized benchmarks. Personas inform pricing framing, CTA copy, and even the type of bonuses we offer.

## Step 6: Keep them alive

Personas decay if you treat them as one-time documents. I schedule quarterly refresh calls, monitor community chatter, and add notes whenever support tickets highlight new objections. Notion databases make it easy to log quotes with timestamps and tags.

## Interview logistics cheat sheet

- Use Calendly with buffer times so you can debrief immediately after.\n- Send prompts ahead of time but keep them broad; I don’t want rehearsed answers.\n- Record with backup audio (Voice Memos) in case Riverside glitches.\n- Start with easy questions about the person’s day to build rapport.\n- End every call by asking, “Who else should I talk to?” to keep the pipeline full.

## Tool stack

Notion handles transcripts, tagging, and persona cards. Miro hosts the force diagram. Airtable stores participant info, incentives, and follow-up notes. I use Otter or Riverside for transcription when Notion isn’t available. Everything links together so stakeholders can trace any claim back to the source quote.

## Case study: Course platform review

I interviewed six creators about course platforms. JTBD analysis revealed two distinct jobs: “Launch fast without code” and “Scale a multi-instructor academy.” The first group feared tech overwhelm, so our review highlighted templates, concierge onboarding, and pricing flexibility. The second group cared about API access and compliance, so we built tables comparing SCORM support and audit logs. Conversions increased 41% because each persona saw themselves reflected in the content.

## Common pitfalls

1. **Talking too much.** Interviews should be 80% participant, 20% you.\n2. **Chasing demographics.** Stick to jobs and anxieties, not age or job titles.\n3. **Skipping negative feedback.** Losing deals teaches more than wins.\n4. **Overloading briefs.** Keep persona cards scannable; link to deeper research elsewhere.\n5. **Letting insights stagnate.** If a quote is older than six months, verify it still applies.

## Outputs you can hand to stakeholders

- JTBD interview summary deck with key quotes.
- Persona cards ready for design handoff.
- Objection library feeding into FAQ modules and sales enablement.
- Bonus concept backlog aligned to jobs.

## Implementation checklist

- Recruit diverse participants and schedule interviews.\n- Record and transcribe with backups.\n- Map quotes into push/pull/inertia/anxiety quadrants.\n- Draft persona briefs with job statements and objections.\n- Align bonuses, CTAs, and offers to those jobs.\n- Set reminders for quarterly refreshes.\n- Share outputs with writing, design, and partner teams.

## Distribute the insights

Personas shouldn’t live in your head. I host a 30-minute playback session for stakeholders, walking through the force diagram and reading actual quotes. Designers hear the same stories as copywriters, and partner managers understand why we request certain bonuses. I also create shareable PDF cards so agencies or freelancers can plug into the same language.

## Maintain empathy

The biggest benefit of JTBD interviews is empathy. We hear frustrations in real voices and see the contexts in which products live. I revisit clips before major campaigns to remind myself who I’m writing for. This keeps the tone conversational and prevents hype-driven copy.

## Why this matters

Affiliate content should feel like advice from someone who “gets it.” JTBD personas keep copy grounded in reality, help partners trust your recommendations, and make refresh cycles faster because you know exactly which sections to update when jobs evolve. Invest in the interviews once and every asset—reviews, comparison pages, emails, webinars—benefits from the clarity. Your audience will feel seen, and that’s when they click. Keep interviewing, keep updating, and your personas will stay alive. Treat them like living documents and they’ll reward you. Your partners will feel the difference too. Everyone wins. Keep asking better questions. Curiosity compounds ROI. Keep listening. Empathy wins every launch.
